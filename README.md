# importToDatabase
This was created for my database project where I needed to load custom CSV files into a AWS RDS server. Certain areas have been redacted for privacy.

Just because I'm lazy I created multiple arrays that store all of my CSV data. If your CSV contained a header row you could do fancy stuff with arraylists to dynamically create and modify your header rows.
